-- COMPREHENSIVE RLS SECURITY FIX
-- Fix all permissive policies and add missing protections

-- Step 1: Fix handle_new_user function to use app_users instead of profiles_backup
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS trigger
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
SET search_path TO 'public'
AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Ensure there's at least one organization
  IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM public.hotel_settings) THEN
    INSERT INTO public.hotel_settings (org_id, name)
    VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), 'Mon HÃ´tel');
  END IF;
  
  -- Create user profile in app_users with first available organization
  INSERT INTO public.app_users (user_id, org_id, email, full_name, login)
  SELECT 
    NEW.id,
    (SELECT org_id FROM public.hotel_settings LIMIT 1),
    NEW.email,
    COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', NEW.email),
    LOWER(LEFT(COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', NEW.email), 10))
  WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.app_users WHERE user_id = NEW.id
  );
  
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$;

-- Step 2: Drop all overly permissive policies
