-- Migration to fix Security Definer View warnings
-- This addresses the linter warning about views using SECURITY DEFINER functions

-- First, let's add RLS policies to the views that need organization-level filtering
-- We'll convert views to use RLS instead of relying on SECURITY DEFINER functions

-- Enable RLS on views that don't have it yet (if needed)
-- Note: Views inherit RLS from their underlying tables, so we need to ensure proper policies

-- 1. Create a non-SECURITY DEFINER version of get_current_user_org_id for views
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.get_user_org_id_for_views()
RETURNS uuid
LANGUAGE sql
STABLE
SET search_path TO 'public'
AS $function$
  -- This version is not SECURITY DEFINER, so it uses the caller's permissions
  SELECT org_id 
  FROM public.app_users 
  WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
  AND active = true
  LIMIT 1;
$function$;

-- 2. Update the arrangements_with_calculated_price view to use RLS instead
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW public.arrangements_with_calculated_price
WITH (security_barrier=true)
AS 
SELECT 
    id,
    org_id,
    code,
    label,
    description,
    base_price,
    is_active,
    valid_from,
    valid_until,
    min_nights,
    max_nights,
    created_at,
    updated_at,
    (COALESCE(( SELECT sum(
                CASE
                    WHEN ars.is_included THEN (0)::numeric
                    ELSE (ars.quantity * COALESCE(ars.unit_price, (0)::numeric))
                END) AS sum
           FROM arrangement_services ars
          WHERE (ars.arrangement_id = a.id)), (0)::numeric) + COALESCE(base_price, (0)::numeric)) AS calculated_price,
    ( SELECT count(*) AS count
           FROM arrangement_services ars
          WHERE (ars.arrangement_id = a.id)) AS services_count
FROM arrangements a
-- Remove the WHERE clause with SECURITY DEFINER function
-- RLS on the underlying arrangements table will handle org filtering
;

-- 3. Update the guest_stay_history view
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW public.guest_stay_history
WITH (security_barrier=true)
AS 
SELECT 
    g.id AS guest_id,
    g.first_name,
    g.last_name,
    g.email,
    g.phone,
    r.id AS reservation_id,
    r.reference AS reservation_reference,
    r.date_arrival,
    r.date_departure,
    (r.date_departure - r.date_arrival) AS nights_count,
    r.adults,
    r.children,
    r.rate_total,
    r.status AS reservation_status,
    rm.number AS room_number,
    rm.type AS room_type,
    i.number AS invoice_number,
    i.total_amount AS invoice_total
FROM (((guests g
     LEFT JOIN reservations r ON ((g.id = r.guest_id)))
     LEFT JOIN rooms rm ON ((r.room_id = rm.id)))
     LEFT JOIN invoices i ON ((r.id = i.reservation_id)))
-- Remove the WHERE clause with SECURITY DEFINER function
-- RLS on the underlying tables will handle org filtering
ORDER BY r.date_arrival DESC;

-- 4. Update the housekeeping_tasks_with_staff view
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW public.housekeeping_tasks_with_staff
WITH (security_barrier=true)
AS 
SELECT 
    t.id,
    t.org_id,
    t.room_number,
    t.task_type,
    t.status,
    t.priority,
    t.assigned_to,
    t.estimated_duration,
    t.actual_duration,
    t.checklist_items,
    t.notes,
    t.special_instructions,
    t.guest_status,
    t.scheduled_start,
    t.started_at,
    t.completed_at,
    t.quality_score,
    t.quality_notes,
    t.linen_change_details,
    t.created_at,
    t.updated_at,
    t.created_by,
    s.name AS assigned_staff_name,
    s.role AS assigned_staff_role,
    s.status AS assigned_staff_status
FROM (housekeeping_tasks t
     LEFT JOIN housekeeping_staff s ON ((t.assigned_to = s.id)))
-- Remove the WHERE clause with SECURITY DEFINER function
-- RLS on the underlying tables will handle org filtering
;

-- 5. Update the room_status_summary view
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW public.room_status_summary
WITH (security_barrier=true)
AS 
SELECT 
    org_id,
    room_number,
    guest_status,
    count(
        CASE
            WHEN (status = 'pending'::text) THEN 1
            ELSE NULL::integer
        END) AS pending_tasks,
    count(
        CASE
            WHEN (status = 'in_progress'::text) THEN 1
            ELSE NULL::integer
        END) AS in_progress_tasks,
    count(
        CASE
            WHEN (status = 'completed'::text) THEN 1
            ELSE NULL::integer
        END) AS completed_tasks,
    max(
        CASE
            WHEN (priority = 'high'::text) THEN 1
            ELSE 0
        END) AS has_urgent_tasks
FROM housekeeping_tasks 
-- Remove the WHERE clause with SECURITY DEFINER function
-- RLS on the underlying housekeeping_tasks table will handle org filtering
GROUP BY org_id, room_number, guest_status;

-- 6. Add RLS policies to ensure views are properly secured
-- These policies will ensure that users can only see data from their own organization

-- Create RLS policy for arrangements_with_calculated_price view access
-- (This uses the underlying table's RLS, but we can add an additional layer)
CREATE POLICY "Users can view arrangements calculations for their org"
ON public.arrangements
FOR SELECT
USING (org_id = (
    SELECT org_id 
    FROM public.app_users 
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
    AND active = true
    LIMIT 1
));

-- 7. Add security barrier to existing views to ensure RLS is properly enforced
-- Note: security_barrier=true ensures that RLS policies are enforced even in views

-- Document the security approach
